1.  Introduction

   TODO Introduction

   For a group of n members, the additional cost of using the extension
   is log(n) hashes and one signature operation per commit to send and
   verify.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  UpdatePath Commitments

   An UpdatePath Commitment is sent as an AAD component in any Commit
   messages with an UpdatePath.  It contains a hash of each path_secret,
   and the Committer's signature over the commitment.

3.1.  Including an UpdatePath Commitment

   committer_signature_public_key is the Committer's
   LeafNode.signature_key. committer_signature_private_key is the
   private key corresponding to that public key.

   The Committer calculates the path_secret hash and a hash of its own
   signature public key as follows: ~~~ path_secret_hash[n] =
   RefHash("MLS 1.0 path secret hash", path_secret[n])

   committer_signature_key_hash = Hash(committer_signature_public_key)
   ~~~

   Then the Committer:

   *  fills in the PathSecretCommitmentTBS data structure, and the
      PathSecretCommitment except its signature;

   *  generates the signature in the PathSecretCommitment data
      structure;

   *  and includes the PathSecretCommitment in an AAD component of the
      Commit.

   struct {
     HashReference path_secret_hashes<V>;
     HashReference committer_signature_key_hash;
     /* SignWithLabel(committer_signature_private_key,               */
     /*  "PathSecretCommitmentTBS", PathSecretCommitmentTBS) */
     opaque signature<V>;
   } PathSecretCommitment;

   struct {
     Ciphersuite ciphersuite;
     opaque group_id<V>;
     uint64 epoch;
     opaque confirmed_transcript_hash<V>;
     Hash path_secret_hashes<V>;
     Hash signature_key_hash;
     uint32 sender_leaf_node;
   } PathSecretCommitmentTBS;

3.2.  Verification of PathSecretCommitment

   After validating an incoming Commit, each member checks the
   PathSecretCommitment.signature.

   VerifyWithLabel(committer_signature_public_key,
     "PathSecretCommitmentTBS", PathSecretCommitmentTBS,
      PathSecretCommitment.signature)

   Next each member checks the hash of each path_secret decrypted from
   the UpdatePath.  If the path_secret[i] is encrypted to the receiving
   member, it decrypts the path_secret using the private key for the
   node as usual.  If the path_secret_hash[i] is equal to RefHash("MLS
   1.0 path secret hash", path_secret[i]), then the member confirms that
   the commitment is consistent for that member.

   If a member discovers that its path_secret does NOT match the hash
   provided, it has strong evidence that the Committer acted maliciously
   and can prove it.

3.3.  Generating a Proof of a Malicious UpdatePath

   To generate a proof, a member whose hashes did not match the relevant
   commitments provides the Commit message, and any path_secret that
   didn't match the commit hash, to the DS and/or the other members so
   the remaining honest parties can automatically recover.

   The prover constructs the following structures as evidence.

   struct {
     uint32 receiver_leaf_index;
     MLSMessage private_commit_message;
     MaliciousPathSecret malicious_path_secrets<V>;
     /* SignWithLabel(receiver_private_signature_key, */
     /*   "MaliciousUpdatePathProofTBS", MaliciousUpdatePathProofTBS) */
     opaque receiver_signature<V>;
   } MaliciousUpdatePathProof

   struct {
     uint32 receiver_leaf_index;
     MLSMessage commit_message;
     MaliciousPathSecret malicious_path_secrets<V>;
   } MaliciousUpdatePathProofTBS;

   struct {
     uint8 n;
     opaque presented_secret<V>;
   } MaliciousPathSecret

3.4.  Validating the Proof

   The receiver of such a proof, validates the proof with the following
   steps.

   *  First it verifies the committer's signature on the
      MaliciousUpdatePathProof.private_commit_message.

   *  It locates the UpdatePath and finds the receiver_leaf_index in the
      path.

   *  Then it extracts the PathSecretCommitment from the Commit
      message's AAD.

   *  For each of the MaliciousUpdatePathProof.malicious_path_secrets,
      at level n:

      -  verifies that the receiver_leaf_index should be privy to level
         n

      -  checks that RefHash("MLS 1.0 path secret hash",
         presented_secret) is not the same as
         PathSecretCommitment.path_secret_hashes[n]

      -  encrypts presented_secret with the previous epoch's public key
         at level n of the resolution covering receiver_leaf_index, and
         verifies that the cipher text matches the cipher text in the
         appropriate
         FramedContent.commit.path.nodes.encrypted_path_secret of
         MaliciousUpdatePathProof.commit_message.

   *  It verifies the MaliciousPathSecret.signature and that the
      signature_public_key used to sign the
      MaliciousPathSecret.receiver_private_signature_key corresponds to
      the receiver_leaf_index.
